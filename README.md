# Hey Dali!

### What is this?
Hi! Welcome to the source files for my landing page. I'm writing this as part of my application for the Dartmouth's Dali Lab.

### What am I supposed to get out of this webpage?
In an ideal world, the page would have a beautiful HTML5/CSS layout with a soft-focus, widscreen-fill image of my workspace. A floating header reads **Alexander Petros - Web Developer** with various pagenav links at the top, framed by a persistent drop shadow as you scroll down. Below that is a nice row-oriented flex-display of circular icons, and each one represents a side project or internship I've worked on. You can click on them for more info about my relevant job skills.

### I get the sense you didn't do that...
No :( I really don't have a lot of github side projects and my freshman summer internship was as a research assistant in seed-stage venture capital (thanks high school connections!). I hope you don't think this means I'm lazy or unmotivated though! If all goes well, my webpage conveys that I have the technical skills to work at Dali - or at least the skills to hack together a little webpage in a few days - but also the experience in other fields that will bring a fresh perspective to human-centered application design and product development.

### Oh, you think you're quirky and alternative then.
Not any more. But I wish I was.

### Is there anyone you'd like to credit for this?
My friend Armin encouraged me to work on the 16X CS52 curriculum with him over winterim, and a lot of that is applicable to this application process. So I owe both him and Tim Tregubov - whom I've never met but had one very friendly email exchange with - thanks for the basic structure of the repo. To start the Dev Challenge, I actually just pushed a fresh commit (message: "clean slate for Dali app") with all the source files deleted, since the CNAME stuff was set up already.

### That all?
Yup! Have a nice day and thank you for reading :)
