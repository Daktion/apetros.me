# Hey Dali! 

### What is this?
Hey! Welcome to the source files for my landing page. I'm writing this as part of my applicaiton for the Dartmouth's Dali Lab. I should probably have a *~presence~* on the web anyway, so being told to make a landing page is definitely in my own best interests.

### What am I supposed to get out of this webpage?
In an ideal world, the page would have a beautiful HTML5/CSS layout with a soft-focus, widscreen-fill image of my workspace. A floating header reads **Alexander Petros - Web Developer** with various pagenav links at the top, framed by a persistent drop shadow as you scroll down. Below that is a nice row-oriented flex-display of circular icons, and each one represents a side project or internship I've worked on. You can click on them for more info about my relevant job skills. 

### I get the sense you didn't do that... 
No :( I really don't have a lot of github side projects and my freshman summer intership was as a research assistant in seed-stage venture capital (thanks high school connections!). I hope you don't think this means I'm lazy or disintered though! If all goes well, my webpage conveys that I have the technical skils to work at Dali - or at least the skills to hack together a little JS in a few days - but also the experience in other fields that will bring a fresh perspective to human-centered application design and product development. 

### Oh, you think you're alternative then.
No. But I wish I was.

### Last question. Can you do the cool "code" thing in markdown?
Yeah, it's just backticks.

`sudo rm -rf ~/*`

Don't try that at home.
